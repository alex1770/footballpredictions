<h2>English football league predictions</h2>
<p>
How much predictability
there is in aggregate features in leagues? By 'aggregate features', we're talking
about promotion, relegation, etc., as opposed to individual games which are
not very predictable.
</p>

<p>
This model uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo together with a Poisson model of goal-scoring and a
prior distribution from the previous season to predict future matches. The rest of the
season is 'rolled out' many thousands of times, and the proportion of times a team gets
promoted/relegated/in-the-playoffs/... is displayed in a the tables linked to here.
The predictions early in the season are not going to be that accurate,
though the later ones seem to be quite reasonable.
(They don't take into account real-world knowledge such as what has happened in
the transfer market, who is injured, etc..)
</p>

<p>
It should automatically update itself every evening to take account of newly
played matches.
